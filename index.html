          <p> My name is Evan Cleary. I was born in an outskirts of Philadelphia called Ambler, PA. I am one of 6 siblings in my family. I have 1 twin, 2 brothers, 3 sisters and 60 cousins. All of them are older then me, including my twin. She lives far away now.</p>
          <p> I graduate college in 2014 where I was President of the service organization I was a part of. I then was selected to be a Business developer for a Bio-Tech start-up charged with fundraising from Angel Investors. I later went on to start my own company which is steady and growing. Though this particular business, while profitable, is not fulfilling my creative aspirations.</p>
           <p>Growing up I've had many ideas for utilizations of technology. I have notebooks of ideas stacked in my home, but never the tools or means to execute on them. I plan to learn everything I can about computer programming so I can build more start-up companies. I hope to make many different web applications and mobile applications with my skillset to start to build a solid holding company that generates revenue from these minor applications.</p>
           <p> Then, I have one idea in particular that I believe can be world-changing. So I intend to work as hard as I can until I develop the skillset necessary to carry out my greatest idea. </p>
