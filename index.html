          <p> My name is Evan Cleary. I was born in a suburb outside of Philadelphia called Ambler, PA. I am one of 6 siblings in my family. I have 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All of them are older then me, including my twin. My twin is a Fraternal twin and is a girl named Rory. She lives in Boston now.</p>
          <p> I went to Villanova University where I was president of the service organization I was a part of. I then went on to help fundraise for a Bio-Tech start-up based around orthotics for people with drop-foot syndrome. I later went on to start my own start-up which is a Property & Casualty insurance agency that specializes in working with clients during the Financial Planning process.</p>
           <p>Growing up I've had many ideas for cool utilizations of technology. However to this day they remain just ideas that I can't formulate on my own. Instead of relying on the work of others to carry out my vision, I have decided to learn the skills myself. Therefore I can carry my visions out utilizing self-motivation. I hope to make many different webapplications and mobile applications with my skillset that can help make the world a better place. I have one idea in particular that I believe can be world-changing. </p>
